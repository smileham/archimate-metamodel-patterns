    documentation="Archimate 3: http://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/archimate3-doc/chap10.html#_Toc489946101&#xA;An artifact represents a piece of data that is used or produced in a software development process, or by deployment and operation of an IT system.&#xA;&#xA;Smileham:&#xA;The Artifact element seems to be the most &quot;overloaded&quot; concept within Archimate, as a result I tend to use &lt;&lt;Stereotypes>> to differentiate between different usages.&#xA;&#xA;* At it's most basic, the Artifact element represents a file on a file system.&#xA;* &lt;&lt;Software>>: The &quot;raw&quot; executable files which implements a logical &quot;Application&quot; or &quot;System Software&quot; i.e. In Archimate the application/software is the running instance which enables functions/behaviours, etc, the underlying files which are executed by the system or define configuration are representated as Artifacts.&#xA;* &lt;&lt;Database>>: The physical database (or schema) which stores the data in a table structure.&#xA;* &lt;&lt;Operating System>>: Similar to &lt;&lt;Software>> I tend to pull out Operating Systems as a seperate artifact to which represents the &quot;installation files&quot; for the OS, with the installed instance of the OS represented as System Software."/>
